# Chip-Multi-Processor-System
Designed a Chip Multi Processor Memory System. Implemented a
multi-level cache and Simple DRAM and expanded the system to
incorporate multi processor system. Made the system more efficient by
incorporating Static Way Partitioning.
Performance measure done using SPEC traces.
